This is a very simple user authentication React app. Potential user/password combinations have been stored in an environment file, `.env.local`, which has been allowed to be included in this repository. Normally, these would be accessible via a database or some other SSO application.

Please note, the primary focus of this exercise was to demonstrate React hook examples, achieve a basic MVP of the requested actions and add some styling. This was not a monumental effort and took well under an hour to complete.

This was built using Create React App.

This is part of a coding exercise for a job application. Unless you are part of the hiring team for this exercise, assume nothing.
